BigGamesProject
===============

The aim of this project is to create an application where a player can start games from his computer and invite other people to his game without requiring the user to also have to install the game. The games will be added through a plugin-like system where everyone can write games in scala or java.

See the design folder for the design decisions, the requirements and the architecture.
