BigGamesProject
===============

The aim of this project is to create an application where a player can start games from him computer and invite other people to his game without requiring the other people to download the game. The games will be added through a plugin-like system where everyone can write games in scala or java.

The project is divided into two parts: the API and the application.
The API is the library that is used to develop the games for the application and the application also used the API as a library.
The application is the application that will run the games and some other stuff like the lobby and such.
